# NLP_Project

Inside the 'src' directiory, there are three major packages: 'ChineseSegmentation', 'HMMPOSTagger' and 'ChineseParse', corresponding to the three steps in Chinese language processing.

The other three packages are helpers (adjusting training data format, scoring etc.).

This project consists of around 3500 lines of codes, and was primarily written in Java.
